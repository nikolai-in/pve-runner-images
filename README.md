# PVE Runner Images

This is a fork of Github's action runner images, modified to be built and run on Proxmox VE (PVE) environments.

## Why?

I needed to spin up a CI/CD infrastructure for my job, but we use Gitea and have a phobia of anything not self-hosted. As we develop mainly for windows I couldn't get away with just running Gitea's act runners inside of a Docker container, so I had to build my own images.

## How to use

Good luck!
